AB,"Number neutralization, i.e.,singular (/dual) /plural distinction is neutralized in some environment (e.g., in verbal morphology)",1,"some form of obligatory number neutralization is found, e.g., Bengali, where the singular /plural distinction found with nouns is not found with verbs, which show no number distinctions. This group also includes languages where the neutralization affects only part of the verb system, e.g. Remo, which has a singular /dual /plural distinction with pronouns and verbs in the 1st and 2nd persons, but not on verbs for 3rd persons, Gtaʔ, where the dual /plural opposition is neutralized in the first person only, or Gorum, where there is number neutralization in 3rd person object marking."
AB,"Number neutralization, i.e.,singular (/dual) /plural distinction is neutralized in some environment (e.g., in verbal morphology)",2,"found, but typically “optional”, e.g., Kharia, where the dual marker *=kiyaror* the plural marker *=ki* are optional with nouns and where the predicate in 3rd persons may optionally mark for non-singular number.
